# Where-to-land-a-drone
Semantic segmentation of aerial drone images and detection of the best spot where the drone can land
The following project involves the development of a system capable of segmenting an image taken from a drone and detecting the best landing spot.

The project is divided into three main parts:

Dataset: This section explores the dataset and describes how it is divided into training and test sets.

Segmentation: This part covers the design, development, and comparison of various state-of-the-art segmentation models.

Best Spot Identification: This section details the method used to identify the optimal landing spot and its detection.
